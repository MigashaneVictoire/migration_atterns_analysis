# Project Description
In 2022, the AtlasÂ® Van Lines study found that many Americans moved to places where more people were living. This is a change from before when people often moved to cheaper states. Now, other reasons like being closer to family are more important. I am trying to replicate the 2022 study for educational purposes.

# Project Goal
  * Answer the question "Where are most people moving".

# Initial Thoughts


# The Plan
    * Acquire data from [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w3)
    * Clean and analyse the data
    * Create interactive visuls with Tableau
    
  * Prepare data
    * Rename columns
    * No null values in the data
    * Change column data types
    * Save separete CSV
      
  * Explore the data
    * Answer the questions:
        - Which country have most people moving from/to?
